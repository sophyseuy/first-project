                <p>The best tablet for your needs can be tricky to find, whether you're looking to outfit the kids with cheap, durable tablets for school or just need a beautiful second screen to keep near the couch.And just like Apple's pricier tablets, the Galaxy Tab A7 charges over USB-C, so you can continue to cut non-reversible microUSB cables out of your life. And while it's not as fast as the iPad and its screen isn't as bright, neither is a serious problem at this price. Especially when Samsung gives you true Android with the Google Play app store, and not the watered-down Amazon Fire tablet experience.</p>
